# Milestone 2 Part C: Documents
  
## Question 1

This question is about the code involved in **getting and displaying a user's story**. For **Milestone 2 Part A** you were asked to redesign your Tweeter UI code (including the "user story" code) based on the MVP pattern. Please answer the following and provide a simple **UML class diagram** and a simple **UML sequence diagram** to support your answers:

1. Which types (classes, interfaces, react components) play each of the key roles in the pattern (model, view, presenter)? How are those types related in your design? How do they avoid a Presenter-layer dependency on the View layer?
1. In brief what are 2 or 3 reasons why the MVP pattern is an effective choice for your design? You may want to refer to your diagram to support your reasoning.

*Notes about the UML diagrams.* The diagrams should reflect your Tweeter code (rather than say a generic diagram of the MVP pattern). Include only the class/interfaces, attributes, operations and relationships needed to support your answers. Recall that UML class diagrams are organized around classes (and interfaces) and illustrate their structural relationships, while sequence diagrams are organized around objects and illustrate sequences of method calls between those objects. 

## Question 2

As part of **Milestone 2 Part B** you were asked to use the template method pattern to reduce code duplication in your Tweeter UI code. Select one part of your code where the template method pattern was used and answer the following questions based on your design. Please include two simple UML class diagrams to help illustrate your answers. One class diagram to capture the design before the template method pattern was introduced, and the other to capture the design after the template method pattern was introduced.

- A. Which classes play each of the key roles in the pattern? Describe the relationship between the classes and how they work together (including explaining what behavior is in the super class and what behavior is deferred to the subclasses).
- B. Explain how the template method pattern allowed you to reduce code duplication. Please be specific and refer to the accompanying UML class diagrams as needed.

*Notes about the UML diagrams.* The after diagram should reflect your Tweeter code design (rather than say a generic diagram of the template method pattern). Include only the class, attributes, operations and relationships needed to support your answers, and in particular to illustrate salient before and after aspects of the design.
